# Background to T-SQL Querying and Programming

## Theoretical background

### SQL

SQL = *Structured Query Language*.
Is a standard language designed to query y and manage data in Relational DataBase Management Systems (RDBMSs).
An RDBMS is a DB management system based on the relational model, which is based on mathematical branches: set theory & predicate logic.

SQL Standard is made of multiple parts. Part 1 provides the framework and Part 2 defines the foundation with SQL core elements.

SQL uses declarative programming paradigm: requires you to specify *what* you want to get and not *how* to get it.

SQL has several catgories statements:
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Data Control Language (DCL)

### Set theory

Set theory is one of the mathematical branches on which relational model is based. Greg Cantor's set definition:

> By a *"set"* we mean any collection M into a whole definite, distinct objects m (which are called the *"elements"* of M) of our perception or of our thought.

- *whole:* a set should be considered a single element, focus should be on the collection of objects.
- *distinct:* every element of a set must be unique.
- *of our perception or of our thought:* the definition of a set is subjective.
- *object:* a set is not restricted to physical objects, but rather is relevant to abstract objects as well.

The order of set elements is not important. Formal notation for listing elements uses curly brackets: *{a, b, c}*; but it could be: *{b, a, c}* or *{b, c, a}*
